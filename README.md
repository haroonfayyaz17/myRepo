Application Management System (AMS) works like a Google Play Store. 
It consist of 3 modules i.e. Customer, Admin and Developer. 
The developer will upload an app on AMS in the given credentials, the admin will check either the app, uploaded by developer, is safe for the customers or not. The admin can approve or reject the app. 
There can be more than one admin, the admin can block the customer or developer from using AMS. 
The customer can download the apps from AMS, the recoed of all downloaded app wil be stored in a database. All the information of customers will also be stored in a database. The customer has to sign up before using AMS.
It will allow you to post app description, admin will check that description and then app is rejected or approved on the basis of that description.
